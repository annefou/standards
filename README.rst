Galaxy Tool Development Standards and Best Practices
======================================================================

Following the extensive efforts put by the developers from the `Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC) <https://galaxyproject.org/iuc>`__ into
developing `Galaxy <https://galaxyproject.org/>`__ tools over the years, we have tried to come up with some best
practices. We recommend their usage to the Galaxy tool developers community, both
for contributing back to the
`IUC repository <https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/>`__ and for use in
their own tool repositories.

You can read these Best Practices at `readthedocs <http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ .
